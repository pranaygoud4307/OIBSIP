        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Narendra Damodardas Modi, born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat, rose from humble 
            beginnings to become one of India’s most influential and transformative leaders. His journey—
            from a child helping his father sell tea at a railway station to becoming the 14th Prime 
            Minister of India—is a story of determination, discipline, and relentless hard work.
        </p>

        <p>
            From a young age, Modi showed deep interest in service and leadership. He joined the RSS during 
            his teenage years, developing strong organizational skills and a passion for nation-building. 
            After years of grassroots work, he entered mainstream politics through the Bharatiya Janata 
            Party (BJP) and quickly earned a reputation as a decisive, visionary leader.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2001, Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held for 13 years. His 
            tenure transformed Gujarat into one of India’s fastest-growing states, known for improved 
            infrastructure, industrial growth, and innovation. His leadership in Gujarat laid the 
            foundation for his rise at the national level.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2014, Narendra Modi led the BJP to a historic victory and became the Prime Minister of 
            India. His governance focused on development, digital transformation, anti-corruption, and 
            empowering the poor. Major initiatives include Digital India, Make in India, Swachh Bharat 
            Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, GST, and Ayushman Bharat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modi’s leadership strengthened India’s global presence and inspired millions to believe in a 
            self-reliant nation—Atmanirbhar Bharat. His life stands as a powerful reminder that with 
            dedication and an unwavering sense of purpose, anyone can transform their life and serve the 
            nation.
